# Frontend
- Clone this repository
- Run the project
You need to completely replace the contents of the `main.tsx` file with code
- If necessary, uncomment the code and correct it
You need `useState`, but it is not in the imports, so feel free to import and use it. 

❗Be sure to configure `Prettier` to format the code in a consistent style
